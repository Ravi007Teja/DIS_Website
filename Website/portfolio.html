                        <p>Spotify's Web API provides access to the song details.
                            The dataset contains track, playlist, artist details and popularity along with 12 audio
                            features.
                            Each track has 12 audio features: confidence measure like acousticness, liveness,
                            speechiness,
                            and instrumentalness, as well as perceptual measurements like energy, loudness,
                            danceability,
                            and valence (positiveness) and descriptors like duration, tempo, key, and mode. </p>
                        <p>We explored the data and answered the following questions: Is it possible to classify songs
                            into
                            genres with just audio features? Also what are the most important feature to classify songs
                            into different genres? Based on auditory features, what are the similar playlists?</p>
                        <p>For instance, the heatmap displayed on this page provided these insights: Across all songs and genres in the dataset,
                            energy and loudness are fairly highly correlated (0.68). Energy and acousticness are negatively correlated. Acoustic
                            music, as we all know, is frequently quiet and takes attentive listening. . That’s why it makes a negative correlation 
                            with energy and loudness, which makes sense. There is positive correlation between danceability and valence (happier
                            songs lead to more dancing). Interestingly, danceability is negatively correlated with tempo, liveness and energy.
                            We can observe that there is no significant positive correlation between a single song feature and its popularity.</p>

                        <p> Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. 
                            They have over 8000 movies and TV shows available on their site, and they have over 200
                            million subscribers worldwide as of mid-2021. </p>
                        <p>The following research topics were addressed from the Netflix data set: 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Type of content popular among the viewers and popularity of Netflix among other platforms: Most of the content watched by viewers on Netflix is in the “drama” and “comedy” genres. 
                                    Most of the content watched by the viewers on Netflix is rated TV-MA (Mature Audience Only) and TV-14 (Parents Cautioned). 
                                    For their shows to develop popularity, producers may seek to release content in the above two categories and ratings.
                                </li>
                                <li>The different types of media content available on Netflix, when they were added to the platform, as well as the countries that produce it.
                                    Most television shows and films were added in the year 2019. The United States, followed by India, creates the most Netflix content. 
                                </li>
                                <li>To analyze trends in movies, tv shows, subscriptions, and revenue of Netflix. The average Netflix film is 89 minutes long, 
                                    accounting for 31.56 percent of the overall content. Filmmakers may wish to make films that are close to 89 minutes in length.
                                    The number of new television shows is increasing, while their average duration (in terms of seasons) is dropping over time. 
                                    There has been a consistent increase in annual subscriptions and revenue growth through 2021. Netflix's revenue is directly
                                    proportional to the number of subscriptions it receives, apart from other things such as commercials and rentals.
