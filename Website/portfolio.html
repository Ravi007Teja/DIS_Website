                        <p>Spotify's Web API provides access to the song details.
                            The dataset contains track, playlist, artist details and popularity along with 12 audio
                            features.
                            Each track has 12 audio features: confidence measure like acousticness, liveness,
                            speechiness,
                            and instrumentalness, as well as perceptual measurements like energy, loudness,
                            danceability,
                            and valence (positiveness) and descriptors like duration, tempo, key, and mode. </p>
                        <p>We explored the data and answered the following questions: Is it possible to classify songs
                            into
                            genres with just audio features? Also what are the most important feature to classify songs
                            into different genres? Based on auditory features, what are the similar playlists?</p>
                        <p>For instance, the heatmap displayed on this page provided these insights: Across all songs
                            and genres in the dataset,
                            energy and loudness are fairly highly correlated (0.68). Energy and acousticness are
                            negatively correlated. Acoustic
                            music, as we all know, is frequently quiet and takes attentive listening. . That’s why it
                            makes a negative correlation
                            with energy and loudness, which makes sense. There is positive correlation between
                            danceability and valence (happier
                            songs lead to more dancing). Interestingly, danceability is negatively correlated with
                            tempo, liveness and energy.
                            We can observe that there is no significant positive correlation between a single song
                            feature and its popularity.</p>

                        <p> Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms.
                            They have over 8000 movies and TV shows available on their site, and they have over 200
                            million subscribers worldwide as of mid-2021. </p>
                        <p>The following research topics were addressed from the Netflix data set:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Type of content popular among the viewers and popularity of Netflix among other
                                platforms: Most of the content watched by viewers on Netflix is in the “drama” and
                                “comedy” genres.
                                Most of the content watched by the viewers on Netflix is rated TV-MA (Mature Audience
                                Only) and TV-14 (Parents Cautioned).
                                For their shows to develop popularity, producers may seek to release content in the
                                above two categories and ratings.
                            </li>
                            <li>The different types of media content available on Netflix, when they were added to the
                                platform, as well as the countries that produce it.
                                Most television shows and films were added in the year 2019. The United States, followed
                                by India, creates the most Netflix content.
                            </li>
                            <li>To analyze trends in movies, tv shows, subscriptions, and revenue of Netflix. The
                                average Netflix film is 89 minutes long,
                                accounting for 31.56 percent of the overall content. Filmmakers may wish to make films
                                that are close to 89 minutes in length.
                                The number of new television shows is increasing, while their average duration (in terms
                                of seasons) is dropping over time.
                                There has been a consistent increase in annual subscriptions and revenue growth through
                                2021. Netflix's revenue is directly
                                proportional to the number of subscriptions it receives, apart from other things such as
                                commercials and rentals.

                        <a class="image featured">

                        <p> Customer churn rate, also known as attrition rate, is the rate at which an organization’s
                            customer base stops doing business with the company.
                            It is usually that chunk of user base, who terminate their service contracts with the
                            company before a stipulated time frame. For an organization to earn profit, their overall
                            growth rate must be higher than their churn rate.
                            In the telecommunications business, the churn rate is an extremely useful metric. It
                            includes operators of satellite or cable television, Internet service providers, and phone
                            services.</p>
                        <p>The following research topics were addressed from the ATnT data set:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Our prime focus was to highlight the underlying factors that may be contributing to
                                possible customer churn in the organization.

                            </li>
                            <li>The capacity to identify consumers who are dissatisfied with offered solutions allows
                                organizations to gain insight about product or price plan flaws, operational challenges,
                                as well as client preferences, in order to prevent churn.
                            </li>
                            <li>To be able to identify prospective client scenarios where churn can be avoided and
                                consumers satisfied, a high level of accuracy is required.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>For this purpose, we employed multiple predictive models and compared how well they fare
                            against each other. The models were trained using 75% of the input data, and subsequently
                            the remaining 25% data was used to assess the trained models and make the predictive
                            analysis. The precision of the models was evaluated to compare them and then choose the best
                            for our objective</p>
